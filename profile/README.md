<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About this organization
We are a community of URV students who are passionate about technology and the world of computer science. Our goal is
to create a space where you can learn, share, and develop skills in basic computer areas such as programming, 
cybersecurity, web development, and more. We organize sessions at the Sescelades Campus to give participants the 
opportunity to expand their knowledge. Join us and be part of the future of technology!
